A drop-in GitHub Action that validates a [Pi recipe](https://pi.recipes) in CI
with the official `recipes check` validator, wrapping
[`@introspection-ai/pi-recipes`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@introspection-ai/pi-recipes).

By default it validates against the **latest published** checker on every run, so
new validation rules are caught the moment they ship — no version bump to your
recipe required. Pin the checker version when you want reproducible CI instead.

```yaml
name: recipe validation
on: [push, pull_request]
permissions:
  contents: read
jobs:
  recipe-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: introspection-org/pi-recipes-action@v0
```

That's the whole workflow. The action runs `recipes check . --profile ci` and
fails the job on any validation error.

## What it checks

`recipes check` is the same validator that backs the `recipes` CLI and the
`pi-recipe-check` crate. It validates the `package.json#pi` manifest, agent YAML
(required fields, `from` inheritance, name conflicts), MCP tool include/exclude
policy, evals pinning, and dependency-lockfile rules. See the
[pi-recipes docs](https://github.com/introspection-org/pi-recipes) for the full
rule set.

## Usage

### Minimal

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
- uses: introspection-org/pi-recipes-action@v0
```

### Pin the checker for reproducible CI

By default the action floats to the newest published checker (`version: latest`).
Pin it if you'd rather opt out of automatic rule updates:

```yaml
- uses: introspection-org/pi-recipes-action@v0
  with:
    version: 0.10.4
```

### Stricter publish-profile gate

Run the strictest profile (e.g. on release tags), which escalates advisory
checks such as a missing lockfile to errors:

```yaml
- uses: introspection-org/pi-recipes-action@v0
  with:
    profile: publish
```

### A recipe in a subdirectory / monorepo

```yaml
- uses: introspection-org/pi-recipes-action@v0
  with:
    recipe-dir: recipes/my-recipe
```

### Validate several recipes in one repo

```yaml
jobs:
  recipe-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        recipe: [recipes/a, recipes/b, recipes/c]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: introspection-org/pi-recipes-action@v0
        with:
          recipe-dir: ${{ matrix.recipe }}
```

## Inputs

| Input           | Default                 | Description                                                                 |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `recipe-dir`    | `.`                     | Path to the recipe directory to validate.                                   |
| `profile`       | `ci`                    | Validation profile: `local`, `ci`, or `publish`. Higher profiles escalate advisory checks (e.g. missing lockfile) to errors. |
| `version`       | `latest`                | Version of `@introspection-ai/pi-recipes` to run. `latest` always uses the newest published checker; pin an exact version for reproducible CI. |
| `node-version`  | `24`                    | Node.js version used to run the checker.                                    |
| `upload-report` | `true`                  | Upload the JSON diagnostics report as a build artifact (`recipe-check-report`), even on failure. |

## Output

Every diagnostic is surfaced four ways:

- **Inline annotations** — each error/warning is emitted as a GitHub annotation,
  so it shows up on the offending file in the PR "Files changed" tab and the
  checks summary (with line/column when the diagnostic carries one).
- **Job summary** — a Markdown table on the run's Summary page listing every
  diagnostic (severity, code, location, message) plus the recipe's resource
  counts and a pass/fail header.
- **Step log** — a readable per-diagnostic listing in the action's log.
- **JSON artifact** — when `upload-report` is `true`, the full machine-readable
  report (`recipes check … --json`) is written to `recipe-check-report.json` and
  uploaded as the `recipe-check-report` artifact, on both passing and failing
  runs. When validating several recipes in a matrix, the artifact name is
  suffixed with the recipe path so runs don't collide.

The job fails (non-zero exit) whenever the recipe has any validation error.

## Versioning

> [!NOTE]
> This is a pre-1.0 (`v0.x`) line. Inputs may change between minor versions;
> pin an exact tag if you need stability.

Pin to the moving major tag to track the latest pre-1.0 build:

```yaml
uses: introspection-org/pi-recipes-action@v0        # recommended: latest v0.x
uses: introspection-org/pi-recipes-action@v0.1.0    # exact release
uses: introspection-org/pi-recipes-action@<sha>     # fully locked
```

The `v0` tag is a moving pointer maintained at the newest `v0.x` release.
Pinning the **action** (`@v0`) is independent of pinning the **checker**
(`version:` input): `@v0` tracks the action while `version` controls how fresh
the validation rules are.

## Run the same check locally

CI and local validation share one command. In a recipe repo:

```bash
npm install         # activates the .githooks pre-commit hook via `prepare`
npm run check       # recipes check . --profile ci

# or with no install:
npx -y -p @introspection-ai/pi-recipes recipes check . --profile ci
```

Recipe repos wire `recipes check` into a `.githooks/pre-commit` hook so the same
validation runs before every commit. This action is the CI backstop that makes
the check non-optional for every contributor.
